## Notes
This version of my 'presentation on presentations' was given to our graduate students during the Fall 2017 semester as they prepared for their guest lectures in our undergraduate courses. The focus is more heavily oriented towards design than my [undergraduate presentation](/presentingData/undergrad). This presentation is part of the pro-seminar course for Master's students in [Sociology](https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/sociology-anthropology) at [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu/).
